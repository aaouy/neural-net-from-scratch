# Neural Network Classifier From Scratch

A simple neural network built **from scratch using only NumPy** to classify handwritten digits (e.g. MNIST dataset). No deep learning frameworks — just raw matrix math and activation functions.

## Features

- 92.3% accuracy on testing set.
- Fully-connected neural network with 1 hidden layer
- Forward and backward propagation implemented manually
- Softmax output with cross-entropy loss
- Classifies digits 0–9
